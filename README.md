## Three Bucket Report

**Overview:** The Three Bucket Report is a live web report accessible by the employees of Hygeia Health. The report takes data such as New Orders Created, Orders Shipped and Orders Cancelled (voided) from the Hygeia Data Warehouse MySQL database. It identified the data as such and puts them into different buckets ordered by their lead source, or the source from which the order originated.
